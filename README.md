# Northcoders News API

--> [https://nc-news-api-vw2o.onrender.com/api]


In this project, I built an API that interacts with application data programmatically. In a future repo, I will use this API to provide information for my front-end architecture.


For future development, the developer will have to:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Dependencies
3. npm run setup-dbs
4. npm run-seed
5. npm run test
6. create two .env. files -->

-> One including PGDATABASE= [with a link to test data]

-> One including PGDATABASE= [with a link to development data]

These will then connect to your database via 'pg' in the db/connection.js file.


Minimum Node version requirement:  Node.js v20.9.0.
Minimum Node version requirement:  (14.10 (Homebrew), server 16.1)
